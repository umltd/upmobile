<p>At Upwardly Mobile, we are working on a bunch of stuff that will change the world.</p>

<p>We are focusing not so much on the big things (Google glasses, the next iPhone, the next facebook… ) but on the small things that have a big impact on how the big things are made and delivered to you.</p>

<p>We are very excited about the Maker revolution and believe this will change the the way products are made around the world. As part of our small contribution, we are manufacturing and selling what are possibly the world’s most affordable 3D printers. Check them out at the following links:</p>

<pre><code>[Xbot.in](xbot.in) - Most affordable, high quality Kits
[Zbot.in](zbot.in) - Finished products with specs that will have you drooling
</code></pre>

<p>If you want us to make something for you (metal or plastic – whatever quantity) feel free to head over to the custom design shop – <a href="iux.me">iux.me</a> and let us know. We would be happy to help you.</p>

<p>Finally, if you would like to hire services of our R&amp;D Design house in matters relating to communications / robotics or manufacturing / provision of custom made 3D printers / CNC machines, please head over to <a href="umltd.in">umltd.in</a></p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to read through this. If you are interested in knowing more, you should follow us on twitter.</p>
