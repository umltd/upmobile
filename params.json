As part of our small contribution, we are manufacturing and selling what are possibly the world’s most affordable 3D printers. Check them out at the following links:\r\n\r\n    [Xbot.in](xbot.in) - Most affordable, high quality Kits\r\n    [Zbot.in](zbot.in) - Finished products with specs that will have you drooling\r\n\r\nIf you want us to make something for you (metal or plastic – whatever quantity) feel free to head over to the custom design shop – [iux.me](iux.me) and let us know. We would be happy to help you.\r\n\r\nFinally, if you would like to hire services of our R&D Design house in matters relating to communications / robotics or manufacturing / provision of custom made 3D printers / CNC machines, please head over to [umltd.in](umltd.in)\r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read through this.
